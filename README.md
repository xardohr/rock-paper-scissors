# rock-paper-scissors

Yet another project that i came across my journey with The Odin Project curriculum.

This is my very first Javascript project where i created a console version of Rock Paper Scissors.

I spent good hours making it, while making lots of researches on google and revising my code over and over and over until i got it right.

That was a really good practice and introduction to Javascript universe and as i usually say! i can't wait to get my hand dirty and learn the complicated stuff in order to grow.
